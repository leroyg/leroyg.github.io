I've sometimes had success when making a decision
in thinking or acting rather in layers. For clarity
sake, an example:

Choice A - Pursue something that I solely enjoy
to the detriment of other goals.

Choice B - Pursue a long time goal, which sets up
next level choices and opportunities, sacrificing
in the near term equal detriment as Choice A and 
also more difficult. 

Easy day, every day for me is Choice B. All else 
equal, let's make the strategic play.
