My mouse and its' movements are annoying.
They weren't annoying for 34 years (okay
24ish years - since I got my hands on the
Apple IIe around then).

However now that I've been both learning 
the command line and doing some actual 
programming type mimicry - I despise the 
lack of efficiency in the interface.

I love that I can walk through my screen,
tools and documents without ever leaving 
the keys. The mouse doesn't afford such luxury.
